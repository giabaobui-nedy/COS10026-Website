<h3><a href="index.php">Image SlideShow</a></h3>

<p>A slideshow is a grouping of pictures or text that consists of showing one element of the sequence. It changes when a user clicks a button to view the next or previous slides, or by a specific time span. HTML slide shows can be coded utilizing just HTML or a blend of HTML and other languages, such as JavaScript and Flash. </p>
<p>The reason why this technique goes beyond requirements is because it was not included in the lectures. We have used it to decarate our website and attract more visitors. This is especially effective for artist portfolios and other organizations with a strong emphasis on aesthetics.</p>
<p>According to our Image slideshow we have used a time span.</p>
