    <h3><a href="index.php">Image Map</a></h3>

    <p>To make the webpage more interesting, we have created an image map to provide an alternative to access our topics.</p>
    <p>An image map is a technique which enables attaching links which lead to other webpages to a particular segment of a photo which is limited by their coordinates in the respective photo. Specifically, with the topic of IPv4 and IPv6, we have come up with the idea of displaying a graphic interface of IP configuration on a computer. This helps users understand where they can implement the concept of IPv4 and IPv6 in their real device. In addtion, with every field representing either IPv4 or IPv6, we have created a range of pixel linked to the topic webpage related to the topic so that if users were curious what all this is about, they can just click in and explore it!!!<br> </p>
    <p>The reason why this technique goes beyond requirements is because it was not included in the lectures. From a personal perspective, we do not usually see this technique applied in common websites. We believe that this type of approach is really useful for a host of majors and also for Kid website as it allows direct explanation to users alongside with the visual illustration of a subject.</p>
    <p>For example, in Anatomy, we can use this technique to specify different parts of a body from a body illustration. Children can interact with Image map to explore about the Animal world or various types of plants.</p>
